# simulation
The code ia a simulation to generate 2, 3 and 5 graphs from the research paper 
'Preferential deletion in dynamic model of web-like networks'
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020019006003632
The graphs generated are:
1. Growth in the number of nodes of graph G with the number of steps t for three different values of the birth probablity.
2. Growth in the number of edges of graph G with the number of steps t for three different values of the birth probablity.
3. Log-log plot of the cumulative degree distribution of the graph generated by the preferential deletion model.

#Notes to reproduce simulation:
In order to run the simulation run the Rahul.py file on a Python3 environment.
Sometimes there is a chance that the simulation ends with an error as a result of all the edges being removed,
in such a case re-run the simulation until you get the desired graphs as output.

#Required packages
random
matplotlib.pyplot
